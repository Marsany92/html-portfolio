<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Marsany Bus—a creative explorer with a passion for electronic music, coding, and web development. I’ve always been fascinated by technology and how it can be used to create new experiences. Recently, I started diving into web development, learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through online courses. It’s exciting to see how a few lines of code can bring ideas to life, and I’m eager to keep growing in this field.</p>

<p>My journey started with a fascination for technology and sound. Over the years, I’ve dived deep into coding, experimenting with different languages, frameworks, and digital tools to bring my ideas to life. Whether I’m working on a web project, designing interactive experiences, or producing electronic music, I thrive on learning, problem-solving, and pushing my skills further.</p>

<p>As I continue to develop my skills, I’m looking forward to expanding my knowledge and working on more complex projects. If you’re interested in collaborating, sharing ideas, or just chatting about coding and music, feel free to reach out!</p>
